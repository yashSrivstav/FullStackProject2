# The Writer Next Door
In this digital era where every skill or talent needs to be outreached to people to gain engagement, there comes a need to provide an open platform to all those writers who want to publish their write- ups and want the world to engage and appreciate their work. This will assist them in boosting their skills and will also help them to connect with new writers.
